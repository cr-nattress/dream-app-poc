## Why Markdown?

Using Markdown for content has several advantages:

1. **Simple**: Easy to write and read
2. **Version controlled**: Content lives in Git
3. **Type-safe**: Frontmatter validated with Zod
4. **Fast**: Static generation at build time

This is just the beginning of our Markdown-powered content system!
