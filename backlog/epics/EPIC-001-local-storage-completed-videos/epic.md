# EPIC-001: Local Storage Management for Completed Videos

**Epic ID:** EPIC-001
**Title:** Local Storage Management for Completed Videos
**Status:** ðŸ“‹ To Do
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High
**Estimated Story Points:** 8

---

## Business Value

Ensure completed videos are properly tracked in local storage with no duplicates and proper ordering. This provides users with a reliable history of their generated videos and prevents data inconsistencies.

---

## Current State vs Target State

**Current State:**
- Videos are saved to local storage when created and when completed
- Potential for duplicate entries with same jobId
- No guarantee of proper ordering by completion time
- Storage structure may have inconsistencies

**Target State:**
- Completed videos stored as ordered array in local storage
- No duplicate jobId entries (enforced at storage level)
- Videos ordered by completedAt timestamp (descending)
- Clean, consistent data structure:
  ```json
  {
    "jobId": "video_68f9bf...",
    "status": "completed",
    "videoUrl": "/api/get-video/video_68f9bf...",
    "completedAt": "2025-10-23T05:38:30.047Z"
  }
  ```

---

## Technical Approach

1. Update storage utility to enforce uniqueness by jobId
2. Implement sorting by completedAt descending
3. Add data validation to prevent duplicates
4. Add utility functions for managing completed video array
5. Update save logic to deduplicate and re-sort on each save

---

## User Stories

1. **US-001:** Store completed videos without duplicates
2. **US-002:** Order videos by completion timestamp
3. **US-003:** Add utility functions for video array management

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Completed videos stored in local storage
- [ ] No duplicate jobId entries exist in storage
- [ ] Videos automatically sorted by completedAt (newest first)
- [ ] Storage structure matches specified format
- [ ] Existing duplicate entries cleaned up on next save
- [ ] Unit tests verify deduplication logic
- [ ] Manual testing confirms proper ordering

---

## Dependencies

- Existing local storage utilities (`src/lib/storage.ts`)
- Video status API response format

---

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk:** Existing duplicate data in user's localStorage
**Mitigation:** Implement migration logic to clean up on first load

**Risk:** Performance with large arrays (50+ videos)
**Mitigation:** Already limited to 50 videos in current implementation

---

## Success Metrics

- Zero duplicate jobId entries in localStorage
- All completed videos properly ordered by completedAt
- No storage-related errors in console

---

## Technical Notes

- Use `Array.filter()` to deduplicate by jobId
- Use `Array.sort()` with Date comparison for ordering
- Consider adding `lastUpdated` timestamp to track changes
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing storage format
